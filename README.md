# why?

I enjoyed developing it for all 3 years, this is my first serious project, but I realized that the code is very bad and I dont want to rewrite it. We are currently working on a new version of LH and wont add anything new or fix minor bugs. Now this project is open to everyone, and it will be funny if someone wants to add something...
